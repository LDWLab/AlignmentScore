# Conservation score

Here we will try to use different types of matrices to represent conservation within an alignment, given the prior information of a pair of groups within the alignment.

We will also use different substitution matrices based on external structural information.

Finally we will try to map the score for each position in a 3D object, by prodcuing a .pml file and a bar graph.
